# VexUI

A VexFlow Editor for creating and playing music.

## Code Example

```javascript
	<div id="container"></div>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		//INIT The UI
		var handler = new Vex.UI.Handler("container").init();
	</script>
```


## Motivation

Mohit Muthanna created an awesome music rendering JavaScript library called [VexFlow](http://www.vexflow.com/). The only problem is that there is no "wysiwyg" editor. This project tries to achieve just that!

## Contributors

Please, please! You are more than welcome to contribute. It's been such a long time since I've been able to work on this project. Maybe you can help it get better? <br />
There is so much to do. For example:
<ul>
	<li>Toolbar needs buttons for bars and clefs. For now, the only way to change to clefs and bars is by using mouse middle button;</li>
	<li>Toolbar needs an area to set key and time signatures, and RPM;</li>
	<li>Implement ties;</li>
	<li>Implement mute notes;</li>
	<li>Add support for text;</li>
	<li>Much, much more!</li>
</ul>
